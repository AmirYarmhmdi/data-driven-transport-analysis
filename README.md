## Notes

- The full dataset (~65MB) is hosted externally due to GitHub size limitations.
- Notebooks use a sample dataset (`Divvy_Trips_sample.csv`) for demonstration purposes.
- For full analysis, you can replace the sample CSV with the full dataset from the server or external link.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure `pandas` and other dependencies are installed.
3. Open notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
4. Run `01_data_loading.ipynb` first to prepare the dataset.
5. Continue with `02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb` for analysis and visualization.
